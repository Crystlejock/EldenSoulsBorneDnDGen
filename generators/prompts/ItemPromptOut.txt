Purphoros rarely bestows Akmon on mortals but occasionally leaves it unattended at his forge in Mount Velus.

The destination you choose doesn't need to be in your line of sight, but it must be familiar to you (in other words, a place you have seen or visited), and it must be on the same plane of existence as you. This effect isn't subject to the magic restrictions placed on the Tomb of the Nine Gods; thus, the amulet can be used to enter and exit the tomb.
If you aren't undead, you must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw each time you use the amulet to teleport. On a failed saving throw, the black skull cackles as you are transformed in transit. The transformation takes effect as soon as you arrive at the destination, and is determined randomly by rolling percentile dice and consulting the Black Skull Transformation table.

Type: Key item
Rarity: legendary


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.
The apparatus of Kwalish is a Large object with the following statistics:

[prompt]Item Name: Arcane Cannon
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: very rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This Large cannon is imbued with magic. It requires no ammunition and doesn't need to be loaded. It takes one action to aim the cannon and one action to fire it. After the cannon has fired, it must recharge for 5 minutes before it can be fired again.
The creature firing the cannon chooses the effect from the following options:
The cannon discharges acid in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 ({@damage 4d10}) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In addition, a creature that fails its saving throw takes 11 ({@damage 2d10}) acid damage at the start of each of its turns; a creature can end this damage by using its action to wash off the acid with a pint or more of water.


The cannon discharges fire in a line 300 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 ({@damage 6d10}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.


The cannon shoots a ball of frost to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The ball then expands to form a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 ({@damage 4d10}) cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage, and its speed isn't reduced. A creature whose speed is reduced by this effect can repeat the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.


The cannon shoots a ball of lightning to a point you can see within 1,200 feet of the cannon. The lightning then expands to form a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 33 ({@damage 6d10}) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the save.


The cannon expels poison gas in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 22 ({@damage 4d10}) poison damage and is {@condition poisoned} for 1 minute. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't {@condition poisoned}. A creature {@condition poisoned} in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

[prompt]Item Name: Axe of the Dwarvish Lords
Description: {description}
Type: Melee Weapon
Rarity: artifact


[Completion] Magical Effects:
Seeing the peril his people faced, a young dwarf prince came to believe that his people needed something to unite them. Thus, he set out to forge a weapon that would be such a symbol.
Venturing deep under the mountains, deeper than any dwarf had ever delved, the young prince came to the blazing heart of a great volcano. With the aid of Moradin, the dwarven god of creation, he first crafted four great tools: the {@italic Brutal Pick}, the {@italic Earthheart Forge}, the {@italic Anvil of Songs}, and the {@italic Shaping Hammer}. With them, he forged the {@italic Axe of the Dwarvish Lords}.
Armed with the artifact, the prince returned to the dwarf clans and brought peace. His axe ended grudges and answered slights. The clans became allies, and they threw back their enemies and enjoyed an era of prosperity. This young dwarf is remembered as the First King. When he became old, he passed the weapon, which had become his badge of office, to his heir. The rightful inheritors passed the axe on for many generations.
Later, in a dark era marked by treachery and wickedness, the axe was lost in a bloody civil war fomented by greed for its power and the status it bestowed. Centuries later, the dwarves still search for the axe, and many adventurers have made careers of chasing after rumors and plundering old vaults to find it.
The {@italic Axe of the Dwarvish Lords} is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The axe also functions as a {@item belt of dwarvenkind}, a {@item dwarven thrower}, and a {@item sword of sharpness}.


The axe has the following randomly determined properties:
LISTS UNSUPORTED


If you are a dwarf attuned to the axe, you gain the following benefits:
LISTS UNSUPORTED


If you are holding the axe, you can use your action to cast the {@spell conjure elemental} spell from it, summoning an {@creature earth elemental}. You can't use this property again until the next dawn.


You can use an action to touch the axe to a fixed piece of dwarven stonework and cast the {@spell teleport} spell from the axe. If your intended destination is underground, there is no chance of a mishap or arriving somewhere unexpected. You can't use this property again until 3 days have passed.


The axe bears a curse that affects any non-dwarf that becomes attuned to it. Even if the attunement ends, the curse remains. With each passing day, the creature's physical appearance and stature become more dwarflike. After seven days, the creature looks like a typical dwarf, but the creature neither loses its racial traits nor gains the racial traits of a dwarf. The physical changes wrought by the axe aren't considered magical in nature (and therefore can't be dispelled), but they can be undone by any effect that removes a curse, such as a {@spell greater restoration} or {@spell remove curse} spell.


The only way to destroy the axe is to melt it down in the {@italic Earthheart Forge}, where it was created. It must remain in the burning forge for fifty years before it finally succumbs to the fire and is consumed.


[prompt]Item Name: Azorius Guild Signet

A signet has 3 charges, and it regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast the associated spell (save DC 13).
[prompt]Item Name: Azorius Keyrune
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This keyrune is carved from white marble and lapis lazuli to resemble a noble bird of prey. It can become a {@creature giant eagle} for up to 1 hour. While the transformed eagle is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with it telepathically. As an action, you can see through the eagle's eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn, and you gain the benefit of its keen sight. During this time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses.
When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a {@creature giant eagle}. If there isn't enough space for the eagle, the keyrune doesn't transform.
The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the eagle takes the {@action Dodge} action and moves to avoid danger.
At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.
[prompt]Item Name: Azuredge
Description: {description}
Type: Melee Weapon
Rarity: legendary


[Completion] Magical Effects:
Forged by the archwizard Ahghairon, this intelligent battleaxe was crafted to defend Waterdeep. Its current wielder is a former member of Force Grey named {@creature Meloon Wardragon|WDH}, but the weapon is searching for a new owner.
Azuredge has a solid steel handle etched with tiny runes, wrapped in blue dragon hide with a star sapphire set into the pommel. The axe head is forged from silver, electrum, and steel alloys whose edges constantly shimmer with a deep blue luminescence.
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The {@spell shield} spell provides no defense against the axe, which passes through that spell's barrier of magical force.
When you hit a fiend or an undead with the axe, cold blue flames erupt from its blade and deal an extra {@damage 2d6} radiant damage to the target.
The battleaxe has 3 charges. You can expend 1 charge and make a ranged attack with the axe, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 60 feet and a long range of 180 feet. Whether it hits or misses, the axe flies back to you at the end of the current turn, landing in your open hand or at your feet in your space (as you choose). The axe regains all expended charges daily at dawn.


While holding the axe, you can use an action to cause the axe to glow blue or to quench the glow. This glow sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.


Azuredge is a sentient lawful neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet.
The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Common. It has a calm, delicate voice. The weapon can sense the presence of non-lawful creatures within 120 feet of it.


Azuredge is sworn to protect Waterdeep, and it desires to be wielded by a law-abiding person willing to dedicate everything to the city's defense. The weapon is patient and takes its time finding its ideal wielder.
If someone tries to use Azuredge against its will, the axe can become ten times heavier than normal, and can magically adhere to any Medium or larger object or surface it comes into contact with. Once it does so, the axe can't be wielded. Nothing short of a {@spell wish} spell can separate the axe from the item or surface to which it is adhered without destroying one or the other, though the axe can choose to end the effect at any time.


[prompt]Item Name: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: artifact


[Completion] Magical Effects:
The creations of the immortal hag Baba Yaga defy the laws of mortal magic. Among the notorious implements that cement her legend on countless worlds are the artifacts that propel her through the planes: Baba Yaga's Mortar and Pestle. These signature tools of Baba Yaga are a single artifact for purposes of attunement. Should the two objects become separated, the pestle appears next to the mortar at the next dawn.
This artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:
LISTS UNSUPORTED


The mortar is a Tiny wooden bowl. However, the mortar increases in size to accommodate anything you place inside, expanding-if there's enough space-up to Large size, meaning it can hold even a Large creature.


The pestle is a 6-inch-long, worn wooden tool. Once during your turn while you are holding the pestle, you can extend it into a quarterstaff or shrink it back into a pestle (no action required). As a quarterstaff, the pestle is a magic weapon that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
The pestle has 12 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using the pestle, you can expend up to 3 of its charges to deal an extra {@damage 1d8} force damage for each charge expended. The pestle regains all expended charges daily at dawn.


While holding the mortar and pestle, you can use your action to say the name of any nonmagical plant, mineral, or fluid and an amount of the material worth 10 gp or less. The mortar instantly fills with the desired amount of that material. Once you use this action, you can't do so again until you finish a short or long rest.
You can also use the artifact as {@item alchemist's supplies|PHB}, {@item brewer's supplies|PHB}, {@item cook's utensils|PHB}, an {@item herbalism kit|PHB}, and a {@item poisoner's kit|PHB}. You have advantage on any check you make using the artifact as one of these tools.


As an action while the pestle and the mortar is within 5 feet of you, you can command the pestle to grind. For the next minute, or until you use your action to verbally command it to stop, the pestle moves on its own, grinding the contents of the mortar into a mush or fine powder that's equally useful for cooking or alchemy. At the start of each of your turns, whatever is in the mortar takes {@damage 4d10} force damage. If this reduces the target's hit points to 0, the target is reduced to powder, pulp, or paste, as appropriate. Only magic items are unaffected. If you wish, when the pestle stops, you can have the mortar separate its contents-like powdered bone, crushed herbs, pulped organs-into separate piles.


If you are holding the pestle while you are inside the mortar, you can use your action to verbally command the mortar to travel to a specific place or creature.
You don't need to know where your destination is, but it must be a specific destination-not just the nearest river or a red dragon's lair. If the stated destination is within 1,000 miles of you, the mortar lifts into the air and vanishes. You and any creatures in the mortar travel through a dreamlike sky, with hazy reflections of the world passing by below. Creatures might see images of you streaking through the sky between your point of origin and the destination. You arrive at the location 1 hour later or, if it is night, 1 minute later.


When you command the mortar to travel, you can instead throw out the dust or paste of something ground by the mortar and name a location on a different plane of existence or a different world on the Material Plane. If that material came from a creature native to the named plane or world, the mortar travels through an empty night sky to an unoccupied space at that destination, arriving in 1 minute.


The mortar and pestle are destroyed if they are crushed underfoot by the {@i Dancing Hut of Baba Yaga} or by Baba Yaga herself.

Description: {description}

If the badge is more than 5 feet away from you for more than 1 minute, it vanishes and harmlessly reappears on a surface within 5 feet of the Open Lord. While holding the badge, the Open Lord knows your location, provided the two of you are on the same plane of existence and your attunement to the badge hasn't ended.
As an action, the Open Lord can touch the badge and end your attunement to it.
[prompt]Item Name: Bag of Beans
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
Inside this heavy cloth bag are {@dice 3d4} dry beans. The bag weighs ½ pound plus ¼ pound for each bean it contains.
If you dump the bag's contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 5d4} fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
If you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The DM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.

01
{@dice 5d4} toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take {@damage 5d6} poison damage and become {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains {@dice 5d6} temporary hit points for 1 hour.

[prompt]Item Name: Bag of Devouring
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: very rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This bag superficially resembles a {@item bag of holding} but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.
The extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a {@chance 50} chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn't pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.
Inanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The DM determines the time and plane.
If the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.
[prompt]Item Name: Bag of Holding
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: uncommon


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.
If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.
Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a {@item Heward's handy haversack}, {@item portable hole}, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.

Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: uncommon


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This scale bears celestial symbols on one pan and fiendish symbols on the other. You can use the scale to cast {@spell detect evil and good} as a ritual. Doing so requires you to place the scale on a solid surface, then sprinkle the pans with holy water or place a transparent gem worth 100 gp in each pan. The scale remains motionless if it detects nothing, tips to one side or the other for good (consecrated) or evil (desecrated), and fluctuates slightly if it detects a creature appropriate to the spell but neither good nor evil. By touching the scales after casting the ritual, you instantly learn any information the spell can normally convey, and then the effect ends.
[prompt]Item Name: Balloon Pack
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: uncommon


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This backpack contains the spirit of an {@creature air elemental} and a compact leather balloon. While you're wearing the backpack, you can deploy the balloon as an action and gain the effect of the {@spell levitate} spell for 10 minutes, targeting yourself and requiring no concentration. Alternatively, you can use a reaction to deploy the balloon when you're falling and gain the effect of the {@spell feather fall} spell for yourself.
When either spell ends, the balloon slowly deflates as the elemental spirit escapes and returns to the Elemental Plane of Air. As the balloon deflates, you descend gently toward the ground for up to 60 feet. If you are still in the air at the end of this distance, you fall if you have no other means of staying aloft.
After the spirit departs, the backpack's property is unusable unless the backpack is recharged for 1 hour in an elemental air node, which binds another spirit to the backpack.
[prompt]Item Name: Banner of the Krig Rune
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
Crafted from a thick, red fabric, this banner measures 5 feet high and 3 feet wide. The krig (war) rune is displayed on the fabric with round, metal plates sewn into it. It can be attached to a 10-foot pole to serve as a standard. Furling or unfurling the banner requires an action. The banner has the following properties.
As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and cause it to emanate courage. You and your allies are immune to the {@condition frightened} condition while within 20 feet of it. This benefit lasts for 10 minutes or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


You can see {@condition invisible} creatures while they are within 20 feet of the unfurled banner and within your line of sight.


As a bonus action, you can touch the unfurled banner and invoke this power. Any ranged attack roll that targets you or an ally of yours has disadvantage if the target is within 20 feet of the unfurled banner. This benefit lasts for 1 minute or until the banner is furled. Once you use this property, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.


You can transfer the banner's magic to a place by tracing the krig rune on the ground with your finger. The point where you trace it becomes the center of a spherical area of magic that has a 500-foot radius and that is fixed to the place. The transfer takes 8 hours of work that requires the banner to be within 5 feet of you and during which you choose creatures, creature types, or both that will benefit from the magic. At the end, the banner is destroyed, and the area gains the following property:
While in the 500-foot-radius sphere, the creatures you chose during the transfer process are immune to the {@condition frightened} condition and gain a +1 bonus to attack rolls and AC.

Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take {@damage 5d4} force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere's wall. No attack or other effect can.
An enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere's wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature's walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.

[prompt]Item Name: Blackrazor
Description: {description}
Type: Melee Weapon
Rarity: legendary


[Completion] Magical Effects:
Hidden in the dungeon of White Plume Mountain, Blackrazor shines like a piece of night sky filled with stars. Its black scabbard is decorated with pieces of cut obsidian.
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the following additional properties.
Whenever you use it to reduce a creature to 0 hit points, the sword slays the creature devours its soul, unless it is a construct or an undead. A creature whose soul has been devoured by Blackrazor can be restored to life only by a {@spell wish} spell.
When it devours a soul, Blackrazor grants you temporary hit points equal to the slain creature's hit point maximum. These hit points fade after 24 hours. As long as these temporary hit points last and you keep Blackrazor in hand, you have advantage on attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.
If you hit an undead with this weapon, you take {@damage 1d10} necrotic damage and the target regains {@dice 1d10} hit points. If this necrotic damage reduces you to 0 hit points, Blackrazor devours your soul.


While you hold the weapon. you are aware of the presence of Tiny or larger creatures within 60 feet of you that aren't constructs or undead. You also can't be {@condition charmed} or {@condition frightened}.
Blackrazor can cast the {@spell haste} spell on you once per day. It decides when to cast the spell and maintains concentration on it so that you don't have to.


Blackrazor is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 17, a Wisdom of 10, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet.
The weapon can speak, read, and understand Common, and can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is deep and echoing. While you are attuned to it, Blackrazor also understands every language you know.


Blackrazor speaks with an imperious tone, as though accustomed to being obeyed.
The sword's purpose is to consume souls. It doesn't care whose souls it eats, including the wielder's. The sword believes that all matter and energy sprang from a void of negative energy and will one day return to it. Blackrazor is meant to hurry that process along.
Despite its nihilism, Blackrazor feels a strange kinship to {@item Wave} and {@item Whelm}, two other weapons locked away under White Plume Mountain. It wants the three weapons to be united again and wielded together in combat, even though it violently disagrees with {@item Whelm} and finds {@item Wave} tedious.
Blackrazor's hunger for souls must be regularly fed. If the sword goes three days or more without consuming a soul, a conflict between it and its wielder occurs at the next sunset.


[prompt]Item Name: Blackstaff
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: legendary


[Completion] Magical Effects:
The Blackstaff is a sentient, rune-carved staff set with thin silver veins. It is the symbol of office for the Blackstaff, the highest-ranking wizard in Waterdeep. As the rightful owner of the Blackstaff, Vajra Safahr is the only one who can become attuned to it. The staff can, however, choose a new owner (see "Personality" below).
This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While holding it, you gain a +2 bonus to Armor Class, saving throws, and spell attack rolls.
The staff has 20 charges for the following properties. The staff regains {@dice 2d8 + 4} expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the staff retains its +2 bonus to attack and damage roll but loses all other properties. On a 20, the staff regain {@dice 1d8 + 2} charges.
When you hit with a melee attack using the staff, you can expend 1 charge to deal an extra {@damage 1d6} force damage to the target.


While holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spell attack bonus: {@spell cone of cold} (5 charges), {@spell fireball} (5th-level version, 5 charges), {@spell globe of invulnerability} (6 charges), {@spell hold monster} (5 charges), {@spell levitate} (2 charges). {@spell lightning bolt} (5th-level version, 5 charges), {@spell magic missile} (1 charge), {@spell ray of enfeeblement} (1 charge), or {@spell wall of force} (5 charges).


You can use an action to break the staff over your knee or against a solid surface, performing a retributive strike. The staff is destroyed and releases its remaining magic in an explosion that expands to fill a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on it.
You have a {@chance 50} chance to instantly travel to a random plane of existence, avoiding the explosion. If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage.

10 ft. away or closer
8 × the number of charges in the staff



You can expend 1 or more of the staff's charges as an action to animate or deactivate one or more of the {@creature walking statue of Waterdeep|wdh|walking statues of Waterdeep}. You must be in the city to use this property, and you can animate or deactivate one statue for each charge expended. An animated statue obeys the telepathic commands of Khelben Arunsun's spirit, which is trapped inside the staff (see "Personality" below). A walking statue becomes inanimate if deactivated or if the staff is broken.


You can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action to cast {@spell dispel magic} on a creature, an object, or a magical effect that you touch with the tip of the staff. If the target is an unwilling creature or an object in the possession of such a creature, you must hit the creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff before you can expend the charge to cast the spell.


This property affects only creatures that use spell slots. When you hit such a creature with a melee attack using the Blackstaff, you can expend 1 of the staff's charges as a bonus action, causing the target to expend one spell slot of the highest spell level it can cast without casting a spell. If the target has already expended all its spell slots, nothing happens. Spell slots that are expended in this fashion are regained when the target finishes a long rest, as normal.


When you cast an enchantment spell of 1st level or higher while holding the staff, you can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check with a DC of 10 + the level of the spell. If the check succeeds, you cast the spell without expending a spell slot.


The Blackstaff is a sentient staff of neutral alignment, with an Intelligence of 22, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet, and it can communicate telepathically with any creature that is holding it.


The staff has the spirits of all previous Blackstaffs trapped within it. Its creator, Khelben Arunsun, is the dominant personality among them. Like Khelben, the staff is extremely devious and manipulative. It prefers to counsel its owner without exerting outright control. The staff's primary goal is to protect Waterdeep and its Open Lord, currently Laeral Silverhand. Its secondary goal is to help its wielder become more powerful.
In the event that the holder of the office of the Blackstaff no longer serves the staff's wishes, the staff ceases to function until it finds a worthy inheritor—someone whose loyalty to Waterdeep is beyond reproach.


When the Blackstaff dies, the spirit of that individual becomes trapped in the staff along with the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs. (A Blackstaff whose spirit is trapped in the staff can't be raised from the dead.)
Destroying the staff would release the spirits trapped inside it, but in that event, Khelben's spirit can lodge itself inside any one piece of the staff that remains. The piece containing Khelben's spirit has the staff's Sentience property but none of its other properties. As long as this piece of the staff exists, Khelben's spirit can make the staff whole again whenever he wishes. When the staff is remade, the spirits of the previous Blackstaffs become trapped inside it again.


[prompt]Item Name: Blade of Avernus
Description: {description}
Type: Melee Weapon
Rarity: artifact


[Completion] Magical Effects:
You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing damage.
When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the DM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra {@damage 6d8} slashing damage from the hit.
The sword has the following randomly determined properties, as described in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide:
LISTS UNSUPORTED


As an action, you can point this sword at one devil you can see within 60 feet of you. That devil must succeed on a DC 22 Charisma saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by you for 1 hour. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the devil follows your orders to the best of its ability. If you command the devil to do something it perceives as suicidal, the effect ends and you can no longer use this power of the sword against that devil.


As an action, you can use the sword to cast {@spell word of recall}. Creatures transported by this spell appear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of the current ruler of Avernus, or a sanctuary you designate if you rule Avernus.


The sword can be destroyed by casting it into the River Styx or melting it down in the forge that created it.

[prompt]Item Name: Blod Stone
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This diamond contains the blood of a creature—blood that appears in the form of the blod (blood) rune. While the item is on your person, you can use your action to divine the location of the creature nearest to you that is related to the blood in the item and that isn't undead. You sense the distance and direction of the creature relative to your location. The creature is either the one whose blood is in the item or a blood relative.
This item is made from a large diamond worth at least 5,000 gp. When the blood of a creature is poured onto it during the creation process, the blood seeps into the heart of the gem. If the gem is destroyed, the blood evaporates and is gone forever. A vengeful being might use a blod stone to hunt down an entire bloodline. Such stones are sometimes given as gifts to siblings or handed down from parent to child.

[prompt]Item Name: Blood Spear
Description: {description}
Type: Melee Weapon
Rarity: uncommon


[Completion] Magical Effects:
Kavan was a ruthless chieftain whose tribe lived in the Balinok Mountains centuries before the arrival of {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}. Although he was very much alive, Kavan had some traits in common with vampires: he slept during the day and hunted at night, he drank the blood of his prey, and he lived underground. In battle, he wielded a spear stained with blood. His was the first blood spear, a weapon that drains life from those it kills and transfers that life to its wielder, imbuing that individual with the stamina to keep fighting.
When you hit with a melee attack using this magic spear and reduce the target to 0 hit points, you gain {@dice 2d6} temporary hit points.
Any creature can wield the spear, but only the character {@adventure chosen by Kavan|CoS|14|Blood Spear of Kavan} to wield it gains a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

[prompt]Item Name: Blue Chromatic Rose
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
While this rose is held, it crackles with lightning as a harmless visual effect.
While holding the rose by its stem, you gain resistance to lightning damage. If you would take more than 10 lightning damage from a single source (after applying the resistance), the rose disintegrates, and you take no damage instead.
As an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of lightning. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 3d10} lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Using this property destroys the rose.
[prompt]Item Name: Blue Dragon Mask
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: legendary


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This mask of glossy azure has spikes around its edges and a ridged horn in its center. The mask reshapes to fit a wearer attuned to it. While you are wearing the mask and attuned to it, you can access the following properties.
You have resistance against lightning damage. If you already have resistance to lightning damage from another source, you instead have immunity to lightning damage. If you already have immunity to lightning damage from another source, whenever you are subjected to lightning damage, you take none of that damage and regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt of that type.


While you are wearing no armor, you can add your Charisma bonus to your Armor Class.


If you have a breath weapon that requires rest to recharge, it gains a recharge of 6.


You gain {@sense darkvision} out to 60 feet, or to an additional 60 feet if you already have that sense. Once per day, you can gain {@sense blindsight} out to 30 feet for 5 minutes.


You can speak and understand Draconic. You also have advantage on any Charisma check you make against Blue Dragons.

While wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to lightning damage.
Additionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest blue dragon within 30 miles of you. This special action can't be used again until the next dawn.

[prompt]Item Name: Book of Exalted Deeds
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: artifact


[Completion] Magical Effects:
The definitive treatise on all that is good in the multiverse, the fabled Book of Exalted Deeds figures prominently in many religions. Rather than being a scripture devoted to a particular faith, the book's various authors filled the pages with their own vision of true virtue, providing guidance for defeating evil.
The Book of Exalted Deeds rarely lingers in one place. As soon as the book is read, it vanishes to some other corner of the multiverse where its moral guidance can bring light to a darkened world. Although attempts have been made to copy the work, efforts to do so fail to capture its magical nature or translate the benefits it offers to those pure of heart and firm of purpose.
A heavy clasp, wrought to look like angel wings, keeps the book's contents secure. Only a creature of good alignment that is attuned to the book can release the clasp that holds it shut. Once the book is opened, the attuned creature must spend 80 hours reading and studying the book to digest its contents and gain its benefits. Other creatures that peruse the book's open pages can read the text but glean no deeper meaning and reap no benefits. An evil creature that tries to read from the book takes {@damage 24d6} radiant damage. This damage ignores resistance and immunity, and can't be reduced or avoided by any means. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by this damage disappears in a blinding flash and is destroyed, leaving its possessions behind.
Benefits granted by the Book of Exalted Deeds last only as long as you strive to do good. If you fail to perform at least one act of kindness or generosity within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform an evil act, you lose all the benefits granted by the book.
The Book of Exalted Deeds has the following random properties:


LISTS UNSUPORTED
After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. You can't gain this benefit from the book more than once.


Once you've read and studied the book, any spell slot you expend to cast a cleric or paladin spell counts as a spell slot of one level higher.


Once you've read and studied the book, you gain a protective halo. This halo sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can dismiss or manifest the halo as a bonus action. While present, the halo gives you advantage on Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made to interact with good creatures and Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) checks made to interact with evil creatures. In addition, fiends and undead within the halo's bright light make attack rolls against you with disadvantage.


It is rumored that the Book of Exalted Deeds can't be destroyed as long as good exists in the multiverse. However, drowning the book in the River Styx removes all writing and imagery from its pages and renders the book powerless for {@dice 1d100} years.


[prompt]Item Name: Book of Vile Darkness
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: artifact


[Completion] Magical Effects:
The contents of this foul manuscript of ineffable wickedness are the meat and drink of those in evil's thrall. No mortal was meant to know the secrets it contains, knowledge so horrid that to even glimpse the scrawled pages invites madness.
Most believe the lich-god Vecna authored the Book of Vile Darkness. He recorded in its pages every diseased idea, every unhinged thought, and every example of blackest magic he came across or devised. Vecna covered every vile topic he could, making the book a gruesome catalog of all mortal wrongs.
Other practitioners of evil have held the book and added their own input to its catalog of vile knowledge. Their additions are clear, for the writers of later works stitched whatever they were writing into the tome or, in some cases, made notations and additions to existing text. There are places where pages are missing, torn. or covered so completely with ink, blood, and scratches that the original text can't be divined.
Nature can't abide the book's presence. Ordinary plants wither in its presence, animals are unwilling to approach it, and the book gradually destroys whatever it touches. Even stone cracks and turns to powder if the book rests on it long enough.
A creature attuned to the book must spend 80 hours reading and studying it to digest its contents and reap its benefits. The creature can then freely modify the book's contents, provided that those modifications advance evil and expand the lore already contained within.
Whenever a non-evil creature attunes to the Book of Vile Darkness, that creature must make a DC 17 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to neutral evil.
The Book of Vile Darkness remains with you only as long as you strive to work evil in the world. If you fail to perform at least one evil act within the span of 10 days, or if you willingly perform a good act, the book disappears. If you die while attuned to the book, an entity of great evil claims your soul. You can't be restored to life by any means while your soul remains imprisoned.
The Book of Vile Darkness has the following random properties:


LISTS UNSUPORTED
After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, one ability score of your choice increases by 2, to a maximum of 24. Another ability score of your choice decreases by 2, to a minimum of 3. The book can't adjust your ability scores again.


After you spend the requisite amount of time reading and studying the book, you acquire a physical disfigurement as a hideous sign of your devotion to vile darkness. An evil rune might appear on your face, your eyes might become glossy black, or horns might sprout from your forehead. Or you might become wizened and hideous, lose all facial features, gain a forked tongue, or some other feature the DM chooses. The mark of darkness grants you advantage on Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) checks made to interact with evil creatures and Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) checks made to interact with non-evil creatures.


While you are attuned to the book and holding it, you can use an action to cast the {@spell dominate monster} spell on an evil target (save DC 18). You can't use this property again until the next dawn.


You can reference the Book of Vile Darkness whenever you make an Intelligence check to recall information about some aspect of evil, such as lore about demons. When you do so, double your proficiency bonus on that check.


While you carry the Book of Vile Darkness and are attuned to it, you can use an action to recite word from its pages in a foul language known as Dark Speech. Each time you do so, you take {@damage 1d12} psychic damage, and each non-evil creature within 15 feet of you takes {@damage 3d6} psychic damage.


The Book of Vile Darkness allows pages to be torn from it, but any evil lore contained on those pages finds its way back into the book eventually, usually when a new author adds pages to the tome.
If a {@creature solar} tears the book in two, the book is destroyed for {@dice 1d100} years, after which it reforms in some dark corner of the multiverse.
A creature attuned to the book for one hundred years can unearth a phrase hidden in the original text that, when translated to Celestial and spoken aloud, destroys both the speaker and the book in a blinding flash of radiance. However, as long as evil exists in the multiverse, the book reforms {@dice 1d10 × 100} years later.
If all evil in the multiverse is wiped out, the book turns to dust and is forever destroyed.

This ring, adorned with the symbol of Boros, allows you to cast {@spell heroism}. A guild signet is sometimes awarded to a guild member whose renown score in that guild is 5 or higher, as a reward for performing special services for the guild. Aside from its magical properties, the ring is also an indicator of Boros' recognition and favor.
A signet has 3 charges, and it regains {@dice 1d3} expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing it, you can expend 1 charge to cast the associated spell (save DC 13).
[prompt]Item Name: Boros Keyrune
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
Carved from red sandstone with white granite elements to resemble a member of the Boros Legion, this keyrune can become a {@creature veteran} (human) for up to 8 hours. In addition to fighting on your behalf, this {@creature veteran} cheerfully offers tactical advice, which is usually sound. Anyone who talks with the transformed keyrune or examines it closely can easily recognize that it is an artificial human.
When you use an action to speak the item's command word and place the keyrune on the ground in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you, the keyrune transforms into a {@creature veteran} (human). If there isn't enough space for the {@creature veteran}, the keyrune doesn't transform.
The creature is friendly to you, your companions, and other members of your guild (unless those guild members are hostile to you). It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature takes the {@action Dodge} action and moves to avoid danger.
At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its keyrune form. It reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature reverts to its keyrune form, it can't transform again until 36 hours have passed.
[prompt]Item Name: Bottle of Boundless Coffee
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: common


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This metal bottle carries delicious, warm coffee. The bottle comes with a stopper, which is attached to the bottle by a little chain. Even when open, the bottle won't accept any liquid other than the coffee it produces. The coffee inside is always comfortably warm, and none of the heat can be felt through the bottle.
Each time you drink the coffee, roll a {@dice d20}. On a 1, the bottle refuses to dispense coffee for the next hour. If you pour coffee from the bottle, rather than drinking from it, the coffee vanishes the moment it leaves the bottle.
[prompt]Item Name: Bottled Breath
Description: {description}
Type: Potion
Rarity: uncommon


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This bottle contains a breath of elemental air. When you inhale it, you either exhale it or hold it.
If you exhale the breath, you gain the effect of the {@spell gust of wind} spell. If you hold the breath, you don't need to breathe for 1 hour, though you can end this benefit early (for example, to speak). Ending it early doesn't give you the benefit of exhaling the breath.

While this bowl is filled with water, you can use an action to speak the bowl's command word and summon a {@creature water elemental}, as if you had cast the {@spell conjure elemental} spell. The bowl can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
The bowl is about 1 foot in diameter and half as deep. It weighs 3 pounds and holds about 3 gallons.
[prompt]Item Name: Bracelet of Rock Magic
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: very rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
While you wear this gold bracelet, it grants you immunity to being {@condition petrified}, and it allows you to cast {@spell flesh to stone} (save DC 15) as an action. Once the spell has been cast three times, the bracelet can no longer cast it. Thereafter, you can cast {@spell stone shape} as an action. After you have done this thirteen times, the bracelet loses its magic and turns from gold to lead.
The bracelet's affinity with earth manifests as an unusual curse. Creatures of flesh that are strongly related to earth and stone, such as stone giants and dwarves, have advantage on the saving throw against {@spell flesh to stone} cast from the bracelet. If such a creature's save is successful, the bracelet breaks your attunement to it and casts the spell on you. You make your saving throw with disadvantage, and on a failed save you are {@condition petrified} instantly.

[prompt]Item Name: Candle of Invocation
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: very rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
This slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity's alignment. The candle's alignment can be detected with the {@spell detect evil and good} spell. The DM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.

1-2
Chaotic evil

The candle's magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle's total burn time.
While lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle's can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell's effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.
Alternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the {@spell gate} spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.

As an action, you can blow the petals from the rose to produce a 20-foot cone of acid, lightning, poisonous gas, fire, or cold, as dictated by the rose's damage type. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking {@damage 3d10} damage of the appropriate type on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The coin has absolutely no divination abilities, and its results when you use it are random. But nobody else knows that. When a creature within 10 feet of you flips the coin (after having had its powerful prognostication powers dutifully explained), you can exert your will to control its operation as a bonus action, choosing the result that appears after it lands as a means of gently coercing the user toward a specific course of action.

When you reach rank 3, your coin of decisionry gains a measure of actual divination power and becomes an uncommon magic item. In addition to its normal function, you can use an action to flip the coin of decisionry twice while pondering a specific plan or objective, noting both random results.

[prompt]Item Name: Crook of Rao
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: artifact


[Completion] Magical Effects:
Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.
The artifact has the following random properties, which you can determine by rolling on the tables in the "Artifacts" section of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}:
LISTS UNSUPORTED


The crook has 6 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: {@spell aura of life} (2 charges), {@spell aura of purity} (2 charges), {@spell banishment} (1 charge), {@spell beacon of hope} (1 charge), {@spell mass cure wounds} (3 charges). The crook regains {@dice 1d6} expended charges daily at dawn.


While you are attuned to the crook and holding it, you can spend 10 minutes to banish all but the mightiest fiends within 1 mile of you. Any fiend with a challenge rating of 19 or higher is unaffected. Each banished fiend is sent back to its home plane and can't return to the plane the Crook of Rao banished it from for 100 years.


Whenever the Crook of Rao's Absolute Banishment property is used, or when its last charge is expended, roll on the Extraplanar Reversal table. Any creatures conjured as a result of this effect appear in random unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of you and are not under your control.


When the Crook was last used against Iggwilv, the Witch Queen lashed out at the artifact, infecting its magical matrix. Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent {@spell gate} spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao. If the fiend still exists, it is drawn through the gate. This process takes eighteen years to complete, at the end of which the gate becomes a permanent portal to Pazunia, the first layer of the Abyss.

1-25
A portal to a random plane opens. The portal closes after 5 minutes.



The Crook of Rao can either be destroyed or repaired by journeying to Mount Celestia and obtaining a tear from the eternally serene god Rao. One way to make the emotionless god cry would be to reunite Rao with the spirit of his first worshiper who sought revelations beyond the multiverse long ago. The Crook dissolves if immersed in the god's tear for a year and a day. If washed in the tear daily for 30 days, the Crook loses its Failing Matrix property.

[prompt]Item Name: Daern's Instant Fortress
Description: {description}
Type: Key item
Rarity: rare


[Completion] Magical Effects:
You can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.
The fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors. with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the {@spell knock} spell and similar magic, such as that of a {@item chime of opening}.
Each creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking {@damage 10d10} bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.
The tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a {@spell wish} spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of {@spell wish} causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.

[prompt]Item Name: Dawnbringer
Description: {description}
Type: Melee Weapon
Rarity: legendary


[Completion] Magical Effects:
Lost for ages in the Underdark, Dawnbringer appears to be a gilded longsword hilt. While grasping the hilt, you can use a bonus action to make a blade of pure radiance spring from the hilt, or cause the blade to disappear. While the blade exists, this magic longsword has the finesse property. If you are proficient with {@item shortsword|phb|shortswords} or {@item longsword|phb|longswords}, you are proficient with Dawnbringer.
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon, which deals radiant damage instead of slashing damage. When you hit an undead with it, that target takes an extra {@damage 1d8} radiant damage.
The sword's luminous blade emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. The light is sunlight. While the blade persists, you can use an action to expand or reduce its radius of bright and dim light by 5 feet each, to a maximum of 30 feet each or a minimum of 10 feet each.
While holding the weapon, you can use an action to touch a creature with the blade and cast {@spell lesser restoration} on that creature. Once used, this ability can't be used again until the next dawn.
Dawnbringer is a sentient neutral good weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 14. It has hearing and {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 120 feet.
The sword can speak, read, and understand Common, and it can communicate with its wielder telepathically. Its voice is kind and feminine. It knows every language you know while attuned to it.


Forged by ancient sun worshippers, Dawnbringer is meant to bring light into darkness and to fight creatures of darkness. It is kind and compassionate to those in need, but fierce and destructive to its enemies.
Long years lost in darkness have made Dawnbringer frightened of both the dark and abandonment. It prefers that its blade always be present and shedding light in areas of darkness, and it strongly resists being parted from its wielder for any length of time.
