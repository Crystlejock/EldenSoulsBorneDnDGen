<h1>Festering Asylum of Cages</h1><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Festering Asylum of Cages is a dark and dangerous place, home to madness and evil forces. It is said that the fog is so thick that it is difficult to see more than a few feet in front of you, and the ground is lined with webs. The constant chanting of an unknown voice sets a feeling of unease in all who hear it.

Those who are unfortunate enough to find themselves in the Asylum quickly find themselves lost in the maze-like corridors.
