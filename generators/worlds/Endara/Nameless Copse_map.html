<h1>Nameless Copse</h1><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Nameless Copse was once a beautiful and peaceful forest, home to many creatures big and small. But something happened that corrupted the land and its residents. Evil forces now lurk in the shadows, preying on any unsuspecting adventurers who dare to enter. The thick fog that blankets the region makes it difficult to see more than a few feet in front of you, and the pervasive darkness seems to suck the life out of everything it touches. Webs line the trees and the ground, entrapping anyone who gets too close. And the constant chanting of an unknown voice sets a feeling of unease in all who hear it.</div><object style="width:100%;height:100%" data="Nameless Copse.gv.svg" type="image/svg+xml"><span>Your browser doesn't support SVG images</span></object>
