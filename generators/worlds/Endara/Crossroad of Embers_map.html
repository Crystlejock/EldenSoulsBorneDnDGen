<h1>Crossroad of Embers</h1><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Crossroad of Embers was once a bustling village, situated on the crossroads of two major trade routes. The village was known for its fine pyromancers, who would often light the beacons that lined the trade routes to guide travelers through the night.

However, one fateful night, a pyromancer's mistake resulted in a devastating fire that consumed the village. Only a handful of survivors managed to flee the inferno. Those who remain are constantly tormented by the sound of the fire crackling in the distance and the ghostly apparitions of their former homes and loved ones.</div>
