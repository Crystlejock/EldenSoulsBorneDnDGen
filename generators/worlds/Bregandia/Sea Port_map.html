<h1>Sea Port</h1><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sea Port is a small town that sits on the edge of the dismal and foreboding Mossmoor. The town is built on the remains of an old trading post that was abandoned years ago, and has since been taken over by a group of pirates who use it as a base of operations.

The pirates of Sea Port are a ruthless and brutal bunch, preying on any ships that venture too close to the treacherous waters of Mossmoor. They often lure ships into the fog with false lights, before attacking them and plundering their cargo.

The town itself is a dirty and dangerous place, full of drunken, violent pirates. It is said that no one who goes to Sea Port ever comes back out again.</div>
