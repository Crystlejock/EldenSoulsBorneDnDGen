<h1>Camp Nowhere</h1><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Camp Nowhere is a small oasis in the middle of the Sands, and has been a welcome respite for travelers for centuries. The oasis is home to a small spring, which provides fresh water for those who pass through, and there are always a few tents set up for those who need a place to rest.

In recent years, however, the oasis has become a haven for bandits and other criminals. These scoundrels have taken to preying on unsuspecting travelers, and the once-safe oasis has become a dangerous place.

Those who still choose to camp here do so at their own peril. The bandits are always on the lookout for easy prey, and they will attack anyone who they think they can take advantage of. It's not uncommon for tents to be ransacked and valuables to be stolen in the middle of the night.

If you're planning to camp in the Sands, be sure to keep a watchful</div>
