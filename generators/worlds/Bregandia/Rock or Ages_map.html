<h1>Rock or Ages</h1><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rock or Ages is a location within The Sands that is known for its ancient ruins. It is said that this place was once a thriving city, but it was suddenly abandoned long ago. No one knows why the city was abandoned, but many speculate that it had something to do with the sandworms.

Today, Rock or Ages is a dangerous place to visit. The sandworms are still active and there are many traps and pitfalls within the ruins. However, the city is also said to be home to great treasure. Many people have come to The Sands in search of the treasure of Rock or Ages, but few have ever returned.</div>
