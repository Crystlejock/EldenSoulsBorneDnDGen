<h1>Fort Mayhem</h1><div style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Fort Mayhem is a fort located in the Sands region. It was built by the desert nomads as a place to rest and protect themselves from the dangers of the desert. The fort has since been taken over by a group of bandits, who now use it as a base to launch attacks on travelers. The fort is also home to a group of mercenaries, who have been hired by the bandits to protect them.</div>
